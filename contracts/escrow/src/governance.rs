//! Governance and protocol-configuration entrypoints.
//!
//! This module owns admin-controlled persistent configuration:
//! `DataKey::Admin` for authorization, `ProtocolFeeBps` for release fees,
//! `GovernedParameters` for escrow caps, `ReadinessChecklist` for deployment
//! readiness state, and `PendingAdmin` for two-step admin rotation proposals.
//! Money movement for protocol-fee withdrawal remains in the crate root because
//! it performs settlement-token transfers.
//!
//! ## Two-step admin transfer
//!
//! `DataKey::Admin` is a single address, so a typo'd or compromised
//! `initialize`/prior transfer hands over the whole contract irrevocably if
//! rotation were a single call. Instead rotation is propose/accept/cancel:
//!
//! 1. `propose_admin(new)` — current admin stores `new` under `PendingAdmin`
//!    with the current ledger sequence. Self-proposals are rejected.
//!    If a previous proposal is still active (within TTL), proposing again
//!    overwrites it and emits a `replaced` event so the superseded proposal
//!    is observable.  If the previous proposal is already expired, it is
//!    silently replaced (it was already unacceptable).
//! 2. `accept_admin()` — the *proposed* address, not the current admin,
//!    authorizes this call. It must arrive no earlier than
//!    `ADMIN_ROTATION_MIN_DELAY_LEDGERS` after the proposal (the reaction
//!    window) and no later than `ADMIN_ROTATION_PROPOSAL_TTL_LEDGERS` after it
//!    (so a stale, unaddressed proposal cannot be accepted long after the
//!    circumstances that produced it have changed).
//! 3. `cancel_admin()` — the current admin can abort a pending proposal at any
//!    time, expired or not.
//! 4. `recover_admin_proposal()` — the current admin can clean up an expired
//!    proposal after `ADMIN_ROTATION_PROPOSAL_TTL_LEDGERS` ledgers have elapsed.
//!    This is the deterministic recovery path after an `accept_admin` call fails
//!    with `AdminProposalExpired`.
//!
//! ## Failure recovery model
//!
//! Soroban panics roll back all storage writes atomically, so no partial state
//! can be persisted.  The following table documents each failure path and its
//! deterministic recovery:
//!
//! | Failure                       | Cause                                      | Recovery                                    |
//! |-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
//! | `TimelockNotElapsed`          | `accept_admin` before min-delay ledgers    | Wait; retry `accept_admin` later            |
//! | `AdminProposalExpired`        | `accept_admin` after TTL ledgers           | Admin calls `recover_admin_proposal` then re-proposes |
//! | `InvalidState` (accept)       | `accept_admin` with no pending proposal    | Admin calls `propose_admin` first           |
//! | `InvalidState` (cancel)       | `cancel_admin` with no pending proposal    | No-op; nothing to cancel                    |
//! | `CannotProposeSelf`           | `propose_admin` with current admin address | Use a different address                     |
//! | `NotInitialized`              | Any call before `initialize`               | Call `initialize` first                     |
//!
//! Every transition clears or overwrites `PendingAdmin` so an accept can never
//! be replayed against a cancelled or already-consumed proposal: it simply
//! finds nothing pending and fails with `Error::InvalidState`.
//!
//! ## Compatibility contract
//!
//! The behavior below is observable by deployed clients, indexers, and
//! operators. Every change to this module must preserve it, or ship an
//! explicit, tested migration plan. `test::governance_compatibility` pins
//! each item.
//!
//! * **Frozen entrypoint surface.** Public names, parameter order/types, and
//!   return types (`setters -> bool`, `getters -> total functions`) must not
//!   change without a client migration.
//! * **Total readers on empty data.** No getter here calls
//!   [`Escrow::require_initialized`]: before `initialize`, on a fresh
//!   contract, or after an upgrade that left a key unset, they return the
//!   documented defaults instead of failing — fee bps `0`, max milestones
//!   `crate::MAX_MILESTONES`, withdrawal cap `5_000` bps, cooldown `17_280`
//!   ledgers, last withdrawal ledger `0`, governed parameters `None`,
//!   pending admin `None`. The numeric defaults live once and only once in
//!   the constants below.
//! * **Failure atomicity.** Validation runs before any write, and every
//!   rejection is a typed panic, which rolls the whole call back — including
//!   the admin-nonce burn in [`Escrow::set_protocol_fee_bps`] and any event
//!   already queued. A rejected call therefore persists nothing, burns no
//!   nonce, and emits no event, making retries and concurrent replays safe.
//! * **Event topics and payload arity.** See the `# Events` sections on each
//!   setter. The governance-proposal apply path
//!   ([`crate::governance_proposal`]) reuses the `protocol_fee_bps`,
//!   `governed_parameters`, `fee_cap`, and `fee_cooldown` topics with a
//!   3-field payload (no `admin`) while the direct setters here emit 4-field
//!   payloads; indexers branch on that arity. Neither shape may change
//!   casually.
//! * **Storage keys are the wire format.** Values must remain decodable
//!   under their `DataKey` variant (`ProtocolFeeBps`/`MaxMilestones`/u32,
//!   `GovernedParameters`/struct, `PendingAdmin`/struct, fee-rate-limit
//!   keys/u32, `Admin`/Address). Reusing a key for a different shape is a
//!   breaking change requiring migration.
//! * **Authorization invariants.** Every setter requires an initialized
//!   contract (`Error::NotInitialized`) and the stored `DataKey::Admin` to
//!   authorize; [`Escrow::set_governed_parameters`] additionally rejects a
//!   mismatched `admin` argument with `Error::UnauthorizedRole`; admin
//!   transfer is propose/accept/cancel with the timelock window enforced on
//!   accept only.
