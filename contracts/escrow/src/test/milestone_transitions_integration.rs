/// Integration tests for milestone status transitions (Issue #1340).
///
/// These tests verify that:
/// 1. All five edge cases work correctly for each status-mutating entrypoint
/// 2. Authorization boundaries are preserved
/// 3. The centralized transition matrix is enforced consistently
/// 4. Version/actor metadata is persisted atomically
/// 5. Error handling is consistent across entrypoints
///
/// Edge cases tested:
/// - Valid transition: legitimate allowed status change succeeds with correct event/metadata
/// - Same status repeated: idempotent transitions behave as expected
/// - Backward transition: reversed status changes are correctly rejected
/// - Concurrent transitions: two racing transitions are handled correctly with versioning
/// - Unknown status: invalid state combinations are rejected safely
/// - Idempotent retries: repeated identical transitions do not corrupt version state
